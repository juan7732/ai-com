# ai-com

A chrome extension that fixes my muscle memory

## History

For the last few months, I've been using https://ai.com to go straight to chatgpt, because why not, its shorter...

And like why not, when there's articles like this: https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-ai-dot-com-domain-name-openai

However, quite literally like a few days ago, [someone else bought ai.com.](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/ai-com-flips-from-chatgpt-to-elon-musks-x-ai/)

Who? Idk, I'm too lazy to check, nor do I really care.

What I do care about though, is the fact that now my monke brain takes me to one place that is not where I want to be.

So, here we are.
